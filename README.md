# Network analysis of trade using python
**Brian Dew (brianwdew@gmail.com)**

## Overview
This repository holds the clean ipython notebook files for two working papers on trade network analysis. 

The first paper decomposes each country's imports into four categories based on whether or not goods 1) have central exporters, and 2) have a natural disaster in the following period. Imports reliant on goods with both are expected to cause a decrease in total exports in the period with the natural disaster. 

The second paper calculates each country's centrality oil and measures how changes to oil prices interact with this centrality to affect a country's exports.

Files utilize data from CEPII's [BACI](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=1) international trade dataset.
